#!/bin/bash
# firstrun.sh — SenseCap M1 Gateway first-boot provisioning
#
# HOW THIS WORKS (for transparency):
#
# This script is invoked by gateway-firstrun.service, a oneshot systemd
# unit that is installed and enabled at image-build time. The unit is
# ordered after network-online.target (Requires= + After=), so it only
# fires once NetworkManager has completed DHCP on the wired interface.
#
# One-shot guard: the unit has ConditionPathExists=!/etc/gateway-provisioned.
# This script touches that sentinel file as its last provisioning action,
# so the unit is skipped on every subsequent boot. If provisioning fails
# (exit non-zero), the sentinel is never written and the unit retries on
# the next boot.
#
# After this script completes, it reboots the device so all newly-enabled
# services start cleanly.
#
# This script does minimal work itself — its sole job is to clone the
# gateway repo and invoke boot/bootstrap.sh, which handles full provisioning.
# See boot/bootstrap.sh for details of what provisioning does.
#
# Raspberry Pi Imager's Customisation step can optionally be used to set the
# operator's username, password, SSH key, and hostname before flashing — but
# this is not available in all Imager flows (confirmed unavailable in Imager
# v2.0.10 when flashing via "Use custom" with a custom .img.xz). If no such
# user exists at boot, this script creates a fallback account
# (sensecap/sensecap, forced password change on first login) before falling
# through to the primary-user derivation logic. See the "Fallback default
# account" block below.
