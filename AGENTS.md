# sensecap-m1-gateway — Agent Context

## What this is

A self-hosted Helium IoT gateway and ADS-B (Wingbits) station running on Raspberry Pi 4B + RAK2287 (SX1302 LoRa) + ATECC608A ECC chip. Debian Trixie, ARM64. No Docker Hub, no container registry, no CI/CD pipeline — just a live git clone on the Pi.

## Deploy pattern — read this first

- **Repo on Pi:** `/opt/gateway/` (live git clone)
- **Deploy:** commit on Mac → push → `git pull` on Pi → `sudo systemctl restart <service>`
- **Never** run git operations beyond `git pull` on the Pi
- **Never** use `git commit`, `git push`, `git merge`, or `git rebase` on the Pi

## Repo layout

```
config/       — lora_pkt_fwd and gateway-rs config files
scripts/      — helper and setup scripts
systemd/      — service unit files (copied to /etc/systemd/system/ on device)
gateway-ui/   — FastAPI web UI source
pktfwd/       — packet forwarder binaries/config
docker/       — Docker configs for non-Helium/non-Wingbits workloads only
boot/         — boot config fragments (config.txt, future bootstrap.sh)
```

## Services

| Service | Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pktfwd.service` | `lora_pkt_fwd` 2.1.0 | LoRa packet forwarder (sx1302_hal) |
| `gateway-rs.service` | `helium_gateway` 1.3.0 | Helium IoT mainnet gateway |
| `gateway-ui.service` | FastAPI (Python) | Web UI, port 8080, Bearer token auth |
| `readsb.service` | readsb | ADS-B decoder (Wingbits) |
| `wingbits.service` | wingbits client | Wingbits data feed + GeoSigner |

## Key hardware & identity

- **LoRa:** RAK2287, SPI `/dev/spidev0.0`, AU915
- **ECC:** ATECC608A, i2c-1 0x60 (Helium swarm key slot 0, onboarding slot 15)
- **GPIO:** Reset BCM 17, Power BCM 27, SX1261 BCM 5
- **Helium identity:** `jumpy-carrot-salmon`
- **Fake GPS:** -33.7936 / 151.2489 / 65m (Helium only — Wingbits uses GeoSigner GPS)

## Web UI

- URL: `http://sensecap-m1:8080` (Tailscale only)
- Auth: Bearer token stored at `/etc/gateway-ui/token`
- Runs as: `gateway-ui` user (groups: `systemd-journal`, `i2c`)
- Tabs: band selection, live logs, restart buttons, token regen, CPU temp, Wingbits status

## Primary user ownership — critical

`/opt/gateway/` must be owned by the primary non-root user, not root. The primary user is whoever was created during OS setup — it is **not** hardcoded and will differ between installs.

**Never hardcode a username** (`bitcryptic` or otherwise) in any provisioning script, systemd unit, or bootstrap code. Always derive the primary user at runtime:

```bash
PRIMARY_USER=$(getent passwd | awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $3 < 65534 {print $1; exit}')
```

The bootstrap script (`boot/bootstrap.sh`, not yet written — roadmap item) is responsible for:
- Deriving the primary user dynamically
- Creating `/opt/gateway/` with correct ownership before cloning
- Cloning the repo as the primary user (not root)
- Installing systemd units and running first-time setup

Until the bootstrap script exists, provisioning is manual. The correct sequence is:

```bash
PRIMARY_USER=$(getent passwd | awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $3 < 65534 {print $1; exit}')
sudo mkdir -p /opt/gateway
sudo chown "$PRIMARY_USER:$PRIMARY_USER" /opt/gateway
git clone https://github.com/bitcryptic-gw/sensecap-m1-gateway /opt/gateway
```

## Docker policy

Docker is installed on the device but is **not used for Helium or Wingbits**. Both stacks run as native systemd services. Docker is reserved for unrelated future workloads. Do not containerise readsb, wingbits, lora_pkt_fwd, helium_gateway, or gateway-ui.

## Wingbits specifics

- Stack: `readsb` (native) + `wingbits` client (native), both managed by systemd
- Beast mode is mandatory — NET_OPTIONS must include:
  `--net-connector localhost,30015,beast_reduce_out --net-beast-reduce-optimize-for-mlat --net-beast-reduce-interval=0.125`
- SDR symlink: `/dev/rtlsdr0` (via udev rule `99-rtlsdr.rules`)
- GeoSigner: USB device, handled by the official wingbits client
- Setup/reconfiguration: `sudo /opt/gateway/scripts/wingbits-setup.sh "<dashboard-url>"`
- readsb must tolerate absent SDR hardware (retry loop, does not block boot)

## Coding standards

- Shell scripts: `set -euo pipefail`, executable bit committed
- Python: validate all inputs, enforce request body size limits
- Secrets: never in CLI args or env vars visible in process listings — use file mounts (`/etc/gateway-ui/token`, etc.)
- Token comparisons: timing-safe only
- Refuse to start if required secrets are unset
- Principle of least privilege throughout — services run as dedicated users, not root

## What not to do

- Do not hardcode any username — always derive the primary user dynamically
- Do not add dependencies that require internet access at runtime
- Do not introduce a build step that requires the Pi (all compilation happens on Mac or in CI)
- Do not add Docker for anything Helium or Wingbits related
- Do not generate `AGENTS.md` content speculatively — update it only to reflect real changes
- Do not use `git` beyond `git pull` in any script that runs on the Pi
